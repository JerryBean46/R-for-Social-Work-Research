If you are interested in replicating this report, follow these steps:

1) Download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (the CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org).
2) Download and install the free Desktop version of RStudio from the RStudio website (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3) Download three files from this repository, `Using_R_for_Social_Work_Research.R`, `Using_R_for_Social_Work_Research.Rmd` and `survey.csv`, and save them together in the **same folder**. You can do this by using the green `download` button in the top right corner of the file window or by clicking on each file separately and downloading. Note that the file with the .R extension is the R code that runs all statistical procedures, but does not run a report. 
4) Open RStudio.
6) Use the File menu in RStudio to open the `Using_R_for_Social_Work_Research.Rmd` file you saved from wherever you saved it. 
7) There is a section of the file that has instructions about how to install necessary packages. Follow the instructions to make sure they are available.
8) Click "Knit" at the top of the window that shows all the R code, it has a tiny blue ball of yarn next to it.
8) There will be some activity in the lower R Markdown pane and a new windown should open containing the pdf.
